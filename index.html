// Discuss what is a distribution and describe how the 4 elements of a distribution: level, spread, shape, and outliers can visually describe a distribution. If you want to do something more, create your own visuals of how these elements can be described. 
 
 <h1> Displaying Distributions </h1>
 
 
 The distribution is defined as all the values in a data set. 
 
<ol>
 
 <li> Level: The level of distribution relates to the measure of central tendency of the data set which could be the mean, median or mode depending on how resistant to outliers the data is. Visually, most of the data will be within one or two standard deviations of the mean in a normal curve.
 </li>
 <li> Spread: The spread of a distribution refers to the range. If the spread is large, the distribution will visually be far apart over a long range.

 
 </li>
 
 <li> Shape: One of the most recognizable distribution shapes for a data set is a normal curve. In a normal curve, the distribution will be shaped as a bell curve, with much of the data falling close to the mean or other central tendency. In other instances, the data does not follow a standard curve and is skewed to the right or left.
 </li>
 
 <li> Outliers: If the data distribution for a data set has a large disparity between the mean and median, there are significant outliers. Visually, outliers will not fit on the density curve.
